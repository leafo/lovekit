# Lovekit

Lovekit is a collection of tools written in [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org)
that I use to build games. I've made (or started) the following games:

* https://github.com/leafo/ludum-dare-22
* https://github.com/leafo/ludum-dare-23
* https://github.com/leafo/ludum-dare-24
* https://github.com/leafo/ludum-dare-25
* https://github.com/leafo/ludum-dare-26
* https://github.com/leafo/ludum-dare-27
* https://github.com/leafo/ludum-dare-28
* https://github.com/leafo/game-1
* https://github.com/leafo/game-2


It does a couple interesting things. It has tools for rendering tile maps,
doing box/box collision detection, uniform spatial grid hashing, lists for
managing entities while reusing objects, particle emitters, a DSL for neatly
writing time based sequences, a system for hotswapping images and classes while
game is running for live previewing, screen recording for making GIFs, image
spriting, game state management, viewports, and a handful of utility functions
for doing assorted but useful things.

In the end I hope Lovekit will provide everything you need to quickly make all
kinds of 2D games while still being organized. There currently is no
documentation, and I don't plan on writing any until I solidify the APIs and
extract more code from some of my previous games.
